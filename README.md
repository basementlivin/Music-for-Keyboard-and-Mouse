# Music for Keyboard and Mouse
A browser-based percussion score for the solo performer.

The user enacts a deadpan piece of percussion music using only their keyboard and mouse (or trackpad). Drawing on traditions of [musique concrète](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.672949/full), [noise music](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/10/squarepusher-paul-hegarty-noise), and the chance techniques of [Marcel Duchamp](https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/dada/marcel-duchamp-and-the-readymade/) and [John Cage](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25597623), players are shown a series of prompts that they must complete before moving on to the next one. Instead of traditional musical notation, this score exists as plain text: "Tap the up arrow 42 times", "Press and hold the 3 key for 30 seconds" and so forth. In the relative "silence" of these simple acts, players may begin to pay closer attention to the sounds of their keystrokes and mouse clicks, the drone of their computer, their breath, and the everyday music of their immediate surroundings.

# Tools & Technologies Used
This performance piece/game was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Text editor: VS Code. Animation created with CSS keyframes. Cover image licensed from Adobe Stock and altered in Photoshop with plugins from [True Grit Texture Supply](https://www.truegrittexturesupply.com/collections/photoshop/products/halftone-zine-machine-image-processing-kit). Fonts: [Forma DJR](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/39028/forma-djr) (DJR, 2016) and [IBM Plex Mono](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/48061/ibm-plex-mono) (Bold Monday, 2017).

# Next Steps
Some planned features and debugs for the next update of "Music for Keyboard and Mouse":

• Fix display quirks (the position of all elements creeps up and to the left when you refresh the page multiple times in a row).

• Add interactivity to starting animation and in between prompts.

• Make the design more responsive using media queries for smaller screen sizes.

• Add keycode recognition for operating systems beyong macOS. Correct key entry may not currently register for Windows users.

• Write additional code in Javascript to randomize the prompts: this would result in a more randomized and unique experience for each performer.

• Include timers and counters to help performers keep track of the number and length of keystrokes and mouse clicks. If they're not so busy counting, they'll be able to listen more intently to their surroundings.
